# GroggyRock - Client
This should be a web page which is served up so that clients can join on their devices and input into the backend api so that it can be served up onto the TV interface. 

## Design
* React app?
* axios for http comms?

## Requirements
* User login function (no password required if you say you are joe_bloggs you are joe_blogs)
* Session tokens should be held for at least multiple hours, shouldnt have to log in on each reload
* This should allow "form" inputs for each of the catagories (rules, dice)
